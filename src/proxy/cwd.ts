/**
 * Resolve the SDK subprocess `cwd:` option, falling back to a known-valid
 * path on the proxy host when the resolved working directory doesn't exist.
 *
 * Background — issue #381:
 *   When meridian runs on a remote machine (e.g. accessed over Tailscale)
 *   and the client (OpenCode/Crush/etc.) runs on a different machine, the
 *   adapter extracts the client's reported working directory and passes it
 *   to the SDK as `cwd:`. That path doesn't exist on the proxy host, so
 *   `child_process.spawn(claude, { cwd })` fails with ENOENT — which the
 *   SDK then reports as the misleading "Claude Code native binary not
 *   found at ..." error.
 *
 *   Falling back to the proxy's own `process.cwd()` lets the SDK spawn
 *   succeed; `clientWorkingDirectory` is tracked separately (and emitted
 *   into the model's context via buildCwdNote) so the model still hears
 *   about the user's real working directory.
