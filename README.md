Meridian bridges the Claude Code SDK to the standard Anthropic API. No OAuth interception. No binary patches. No hacks. Just pure, documented SDK calls. Any tool that speaks the Anthropic or OpenAI protocol — OpenCode, OpenClaw, Crush, Cline, Aider, Pi, Droid, Open WebUI — connects to Meridian and gets Claude, with session management, streaming, and prompt caching handled natively by the SDK.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### Meridian is unaffected by the April 5, 2025 third-party blocks
>
> On April 5, 2025, Anthropic began blocking third-party tools that bypass Claude Code by intercepting OAuth tokens and replaying them against internal API endpoints. Tools that extract `~/.claude/` credentials, proxy raw OAuth bearer tokens, or patch Claude Code binaries to redirect traffic may no longer function.
>
> **Meridian does not do any of this.** Its architecture is fundamentally different:
>
> - **SDK-native.** Every request calls [`query()`](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk) from `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` — the same function Anthropic documents for programmatic Claude Code access. No OAuth tokens are extracted, intercepted, or replayed.
> - **Real Claude Code sessions.** The SDK spawns the actual Claude Code process, manages its own authentication, and handles all communication with Anthropic's servers. Meridian's traffic doesn't *look like* Claude Code — it *is* Claude Code.
> - **Documented API surface only.** Session resume, MCP tool servers, agent definitions, thinking configuration, permission modes, tool blocking — every feature Meridian uses is a published, documented SDK option. Nothing is reverse-engineered or patched.
> - **Native benefits and controls preserved.** Prompt caching, conversation persistence, context window management, and compaction all function exactly as they do in Claude Code — because the SDK manages them directly. This means Anthropic's engineering investments in efficiency and their rate-limiting controls work as designed. Max subscription tokens flow through the correct channel, governed by the same guardrails Anthropic built into Claude Code. Meridian doesn't bypass these mechanisms; it depends on them.
>
> A small number of adjustments were made in response to the April 5th changes — notably stripping `anthropic-beta` headers that could trigger unintended Extra Usage billing on Max subscriptions ([#281](https://github.com/rynfar/meridian/issues/281)). We are also evaluating system prompt handling to ensure nothing conflicts with Claude Code's expectations. These are compatibility adjustments, not workarounds. Our philosophy is to let Claude Code be the foundation and never fight the SDK — we work with it and add our own layer on top.
>
> **Our position is straightforward.** Anthropic asks developers to use Claude Code as the harness for Max subscription access — we do. We call their SDK, respect its authentication flow, use its documented features, and operate within its designed boundaries. We are not circumventing Claude Code; we are building on top of it.
>
> What Meridian adds is a **presentation and interoperability layer**. We translate Claude Code's output into the standard Anthropic API format so developers can connect the editors, terminals, and workflows they prefer. The SDK does the work; Meridian formats the result. Developers should have the right to choose their own interface and integrate with their own tooling — that's not circumvention, it's the reason SDKs exist.
>
> For Meridian to stop working, Anthropic would need to restrict the Claude Code SDK itself or remove documented features that legitimate SDK consumers depend on. We don't believe that's the intent. We're building within Anthropic's ecosystem and constraints because we genuinely value their tools and models. We simply want the freedom to choose how we experience them — and we hope Anthropic sees that as the kind of ecosystem engagement their SDK was designed to enable.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install -g @rynfar/meridian

# 2. Authenticate (one time)
claude login

# 3. Configure OpenCode plugin (one time — OpenCode users only)
meridian setup

# 4. Start
meridian
```

Meridian runs on `http://127.0.0.1:3456`. Point any Anthropic-compatible tool at it:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=x ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3456 opencode
```

The API key value is a placeholder — Meridian authenticates through the Claude Code SDK, not API keys. Most Anthropic-compatible tools require this field to be set, but any value works.

## Why Meridian?

The Claude Code SDK provides programmatic access to Claude. But your favorite coding tools expect an Anthropic API endpoint. Meridian bridges that gap — it runs locally, accepts standard API requests, and routes them through the SDK. Claude Code does the heavy lifting; Meridian translates the output.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/how-it-works.svg" alt="How Meridian works" width="920"/>
</p>

## Features

- **Standard Anthropic API** — drop-in compatible with any tool that supports a custom `base_url`
- **OpenAI-compatible API** — `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models` for tools that only speak the OpenAI protocol (Open WebUI, Continue, etc.) — no LiteLLM needed
- **Session management** — conversations persist across requests, survive compaction and undo, resume after proxy restarts
- **Streaming** — full SSE streaming with MCP tool filtering
- **Concurrent sessions** — run parent and subagent requests in parallel
- **Subagent model selection** — primary agents get 1M context; subagents get 200k, preserving rate-limit budget
- **Auto token refresh** — expired OAuth tokens are refreshed automatically; requests continue without interruption
- **Passthrough mode** — forward tool calls to the client instead of executing internally
- **Multimodal** — images, documents, and file attachments pass through to Claude
- **Multi-profile** — switch between Claude accounts instantly, no restart needed
- **Telemetry dashboard** — real-time performance metrics at `/telemetry`

## Multi-Profile Support

Meridian can route requests to different Claude accounts. Each **profile** is a named auth context — a separate Claude login with its own OAuth tokens. Switch between personal and work accounts, or share a single Meridian instance across teams.

### Adding profiles

```bash
# Add your personal account
meridian profile add personal
# → Opens browser for Claude login

# Add your work account (sign out of claude.ai first, then sign into the work account)
meridian profile add work
```

> **⚠ Important:** Claude's OAuth reuses your browser session. Before adding a second account, sign out of claude.ai and sign into the other account first.

### Switching profiles

```bash
# CLI (while proxy is running)
meridian profile switch work

# Per-request header (any agent)
curl -H "x-meridian-profile: work" ...
```

You can also switch profiles from the web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:3456/profiles` — a dropdown appears in the nav bar on all pages when profiles are configured.

### Profile commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `meridian profile add <name>` | Add a profile and authenticate via browser |
| `meridian profile list` | List profiles and auth status |
| `meridian profile switch <name>` | Switch the active profile (requires running proxy) |
| `meridian profile login <name>` | Re-authenticate an expired profile |
| `meridian profile remove <name>` | Remove a profile and its credentials |

### How it works

Each profile stores its credentials in an isolated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` under `~/.config/meridian/profiles/<name>/`. When a request arrives, Meridian resolves the profile in priority order:

1. `x-meridian-profile` request header (per-request override)
2. Active profile (set via `meridian profile switch` or the web UI)
3. First configured profile

Session state is scoped per profile — switching accounts won't cross-contaminate conversation history.

### Environment variable configuration

For advanced setups (CI, Docker), profiles can also be provided via environment variable:

```bash
export MERIDIAN_PROFILES='[{"id":"personal","claudeConfigDir":"/path/to/config1"},{"id":"work","claudeConfigDir":"/path/to/config2"}]'
export MERIDIAN_DEFAULT_PROFILE=personal
meridian
```

When `MERIDIAN_PROFILES` is set, it takes precedence over disk-configured profiles. When unset, Meridian auto-discovers profiles from `~/.config/meridian/profiles.json` on each request.

## Agent Setup

### OpenCode

**Step 1: Run `meridian setup` (required, one time)**

```bash
meridian setup
```

This adds the Meridian plugin to your OpenCode global config (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`). The plugin enables:

- **Session tracking** — reliable conversation continuity across requests
- **Safe model defaults** — Opus uses 1M context (included with Max subscription); Sonnet uses 200k to avoid Extra Usage charges ([details](#extended-context-billing))
- **Subagent model selection** — subagents automatically use `sonnet`/`opus` (200k), preserving rate-limit budget

If the plugin is missing, Meridian warns at startup and reports `"plugin": "not-configured"` in the health endpoint.

**Step 2: Start**

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=x ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3456 opencode
```

Or set these in your shell profile so they're always active:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=x
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3456
```

### Crush

Add a provider to `~/.config/crush/crush.json`:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "meridian": {
      "id": "meridian",
      "name": "Meridian",
      "type": "anthropic",
      "base_url": "http://127.0.0.1:3456",
      "api_key": "dummy",
      "models": [
        { "id": "claude-sonnet-4-6", "name": "Claude Sonnet 4.6 (1M)", "context_window": 1000000, "default_max_tokens": 64000, "can_reason": true, "supports_attachments": true },
        { "id": "claude-opus-4-6",   "name": "Claude Opus 4.6 (1M)",   "context_window": 1000000, "default_max_tokens": 32768, "can_reason": true, "supports_attachments": true },
        { "id": "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001", "name": "Claude Haiku 4.5", "context_window": 200000, "default_max_tokens": 16384, "can_reason": true, "supports_attachments": true }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
crush run --model meridian/claude-sonnet-4-6 "refactor this function"
crush --model meridian/claude-opus-4-6       # interactive TUI
```

Crush is automatically detected from its `Charm-Crush/` User-Agent — no plugin needed.

### Droid (Factory AI)

Add Meridian as a custom model provider in `~/.factory/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "customModels": [
    { "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",       "name": "Sonnet 4.6 (Meridian)", "provider": "anthropic", "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:3456", "apiKey": "x" },
    { "model": "claude-opus-4-6",         "name": "Opus 4.6 (Meridian)",   "provider": "anthropic", "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:3456", "apiKey": "x" },
    { "model": "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001", "name": "Haiku 4.5 (Meridian)", "provider": "anthropic", "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:3456", "apiKey": "x" }
  ]
}
```

Then pick any `custom:claude-*` model in the Droid TUI. No plugin needed — Droid is automatically detected.

### Cline

**1. Authenticate:**

```bash
cline auth --provider anthropic --apikey "dummy" --modelid "claude-sonnet-4-6"
```

**2. Set the proxy URL** in `~/.cline/data/globalState.json`:

```json
{
  "anthropicBaseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:3456",
  "actModeApiProvider": "anthropic",
  "actModeApiModelId": "claude-sonnet-4-6"
}
```

**3. Run:**

```bash
cline --yolo "refactor the login function"
```

No plugin needed — Cline uses the standard Anthropic SDK.

### Aider

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=x ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3456 \
  aider --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
```

> **Note:** `--no-stream` is incompatible due to a litellm parsing issue — use the default streaming mode.

### OpenAI-compatible tools (Open WebUI, Continue, etc.)

Meridian speaks the OpenAI protocol natively — no LiteLLM or translation proxy needed.

**`POST /v1/chat/completions`** — accepts OpenAI chat format, returns OpenAI completion format (streaming and non-streaming)

**`GET /v1/models`** — returns available Claude models in OpenAI format

Point any OpenAI-compatible tool at `http://127.0.0.1:3456` with any API key value:

```bash
# Open WebUI: set OpenAI API base to http://127.0.0.1:3456, API key to any value
# Continue: set apiBase to http://127.0.0.1:3456 with provider: openai
# Any OpenAI SDK: set base_url="http://127.0.0.1:3456", api_key="dummy"
```

> **Note:** Multi-turn conversations work by packing prior turns into the system prompt. Each request is a fresh SDK session — OpenAI clients replay full history themselves and don't use Meridian's session resumption.

### Pi

Pi uses the `@mariozechner/pi-ai` library which supports a configurable `baseUrl` on the model. Add a provider-level override in `~/.pi/agent/models.json`:

```json
{
  "anthropic": {
    "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:3456"
  }
}
```

Then start Meridian with the pi default adapter:

```bash
MERIDIAN_DEFAULT_AGENT=pi meridian
```

Pi mimics Claude Code's User-Agent, so automatic detection isn't possible. The `MERIDIAN_DEFAULT_AGENT` env var tells Meridian to use the pi adapter for all unrecognized requests. If you run other agents alongside pi, use the `x-meridian-agent: pi` header instead (requires pi-ai support for custom headers).

### OpenClaw

OpenClaw uses `@mariozechner/pi-ai` under the hood, so the pi adapter handles it with no additional code. Add a provider override in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "providers": {
      "anthropic": {
        "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:3456",
        "apiKey": "dummy",
        "models": [
          { "id": "claude-sonnet-4-6", "name": "Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Meridian)" },
          { "id": "claude-opus-4-6", "name": "Claude Opus 4.6 (Meridian)" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then start Meridian with the pi adapter: `MERIDIAN_DEFAULT_AGENT=pi meridian`

### Any Anthropic-compatible tool

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=x
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3456
```

```

### Session Management

Every incoming request is classified:

| Classification | What Happened | Action |
|---------------|---------------|--------|
| **Continuation** | New messages appended | Resume SDK session |
| **Compaction** | Agent summarized old messages | Resume (suffix preserved) |
| **Undo** | User rolled back messages | Fork at rollback point |
| **Diverged** | Completely different conversation | Start fresh |

Sessions are stored in-memory (LRU) and persisted to `~/.cache/meridian/sessions.json` for cross-proxy resume.

### Agent Detection

Agents are identified from request headers automatically:

| Signal | Adapter |
|---|---|
| `x-meridian-agent` header | Explicit override (any adapter) |
| `Charm-Crush/` User-Agent | Crush |
| `factory-cli/` User-Agent | Droid |
| `litellm/` UA or `x-litellm-*` headers | LiteLLM passthrough |
| *(anything else)* | `MERIDIAN_DEFAULT_AGENT` env var, or OpenCode |

### Adding a New Agent

Implement the `AgentAdapter` interface in `src/proxy/adapters/`. See [`adapters/opencode.ts`](src/proxy/adapters/opencode.ts) for a reference.

  silent: true,
})

// instance.server — underlying http.Server
await instance.close()
```

## Docker

```bash
docker run -v ~/.claude:/home/claude/.claude -p 3456:3456 meridian
```

## Testing

```

| Tier | What | Speed |
|------|------|-------|
| Unit | Pure functions, no mocks | Fast |
| Integration | HTTP layer with mocked SDK | Fast |
| E2E | Real proxy + real Claude Max ([`E2E.md`](E2E.md)) | Manual |

## FAQ

**Is this allowed by Anthropic's terms?**
Meridian uses the official Claude Code SDK — the same SDK Anthropic publishes and documents for programmatic access. It does not intercept credentials, modify binaries, or bypass any authentication. All requests flow through the SDK's own authentication and rate-limiting mechanisms.

**How is this different from using an API key?**
API keys provide direct API access billed per token. Claude Max includes programmatic access through the Claude Code SDK. Meridian translates SDK responses into the standard Anthropic API format, allowing compatible tools to connect through Claude Code.

**What happens if my OAuth token expires?**
Tokens expire roughly every 8 hours. Meridian detects the expiry, refreshes the token automatically, and retries the request — so requests continue transparently. If the refresh fails (e.g. the refresh token has expired after weeks of inactivity), Meridian returns a clear error telling you to run `claude login`.

**Can I trigger a token refresh manually?**

```bash
# CLI — works whether the proxy is running or not
meridian refresh-token

# HTTP — while the proxy is running
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3456/auth/refresh
```

**I'm hitting rate limits on 1M context. What do I do?**
Meridian defaults Sonnet to 200k context because Sonnet 1M is always billed as Extra Usage on Max plans — even when regular usage isn't exhausted. This is [Anthropic's intended billing model](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config#extended-context), not a bug. Set `MERIDIAN_SONNET_MODEL=sonnet[1m]` to opt in if you have Extra Usage enabled and understand the billing implications. Opus defaults to 1M context, which is included with Max/Team/Enterprise subscriptions at no extra cost. Note: there is a [known upstream bug](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/39841) where Claude Code incorrectly gates Opus 1M behind Extra Usage on Max — this is Anthropic's to fix.

**Why does the health endpoint show `"plugin": "not-configured"`?**
You haven't run `meridian setup`. Without the plugin, OpenCode requests won't have session tracking or subagent model selection. Run `meridian setup` and restart OpenCode.
